        <h3>What is climate change?</h3>
        <p>Climate change is defined as the change in usual weather of a place or region.<br> 
        This is caused by global warming due to human activity and disregard for the planet earth.<br>
        If a combined global effort cannot be made to combat climate change and<br>
        limit the global temperature increase by about 1.5 degrees celsius there will be irreversable damage</p>

       <h4>What could happen if we dont act now?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The UK and Europe will be vulnerable to flooding caused by extreme rainfall</li>
        <li>Countries in the Middle East will experience extreme heatwaves and farmland could turn to desert</li>
        <li>Island nations in the Pacific region could disappear under rising seas</li>
        <li>Many African nations are likely to suffer droughts and food shortages</li>
        <li>Drought conditions are likely in the western US, while other areas will see more intense storms</li>
        <li>Australia is likely to suffer extremes of heat and drought</li>
        <li>Increase in category 5 storms</li>
        <li>Oceans are the largest reservoir of CO2. The warmer it gets, the less CO2 can diffuse into an ocean
            and so more will remain in the atmosphere, which creates a positive feedback loop causing more warming
        </li>
        <li>Only 3% of all water is freshwater and this percentage will reduce as ice caps melt</li>
        <li>Mass extinctions could occur in the future</li>
